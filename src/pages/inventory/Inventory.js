        Helping clients meet their business challenges begins with an in-depth
        understanding of the industries in which they work. Thatâ€™s why KPMG LLP
        established its industry-driven structure. In fact, KPMG LLP was the
        first of the Big Four firms to organize itself along the same industry
        lines as clients.
